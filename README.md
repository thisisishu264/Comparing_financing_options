# Comparing_financing_options
This is my first project on GitHub. This project helps us check which Financing option is best for a start-up. 
I got an assingment in my "Principles of Management" class in which I had to compare financing options for
a tech start-up. So instead of manually doing the calculations, I created this python program using my basic
OOP knowledge which does all the calculations for you. 
The Python Program used has been developed under the following assumptions for simplicity.
1) Monthly Revenue and Expense remains constant throughout the year. 
2) Revenue and Expense growth happens at the start of the year. 
3) Loan expires after 5 years.
4) Investor remains with the company throughout the years. 

The program takes in initial monthly revenue, expense, total loan and at what rates revenue and interests grow. I have included some sample examples as well to 
comapre and contrast.
